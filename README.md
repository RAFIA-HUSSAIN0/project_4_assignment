## Project 01: Add Two Numbers

### Objective:
The program prompts the user to input two numbers and then adds them together. This basic program helps reinforce the concept of variable storage and arithmetic operations in Python.

### Key Concepts:
- User Input
- Integer addition
- Output formatting

---

## Project 02: Agreement Bot

### Objective:
This project simulates a basic agreement bot that asks the user for their favorite animal and then responds with a predefined message about the bot's favorite animal.

### Key Concepts:
- String manipulation
- User interaction
- Conditional logic

---

## Project 03: Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

### Objective:
This project takes an input temperature in Fahrenheit from the user and converts it to Celsius using the formula:
### Key Concepts:
- User input handling
- Mathematical operations
- Output formatting

---

## Project 04: Age-Related Riddle

### Objective:
In this program, we solve an age-related riddle involving five friends. The program calculates and prints the age of each friend based on the relationships described in the riddle.

### Key Concepts:
- Arithmetic operations
- Variable assignments
- String formatting and output

---

## Project 05: Triangle Perimeter

### Objective:
The user is prompted to input the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The program calculates and outputs the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of all its sides.

### Key Concepts:
- User input handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Working with floating point numbers

---

## Project 06: Square a Number

### Objective:
This simple program takes a number as input and prints its square, i.e., the number multiplied by itself.

### Key Concepts:
- User input handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Output formatting
